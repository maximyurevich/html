      On <strong>Sunday January 9th 2010</strong>, a gang of goths were spotted
      stealing <strong>several garden gnomes</strong> from a shopping center in
      downtown <strong>Milwaukee</strong>. They were all wearing green jumpsuits
      and silly hats, and seemed to be having a whale of a time. If anyone has
      <strong>any</strong> information about this incident, please contact the
      police <strong>now</strong>.
